### Natraj, Featuring Special Guest, Indian Classical Virtuoso Chitravina Ravikiran

This concert was presented in collaboration with [MITHAS](http://web.mit.edu/mithas/www/top.html).

Acclaimed world-jazz group [Natraj](http://www.natrajmusic.com/) teams up with Indian classical virtuoso [Sangeet Samrat Chitravina N. Ravikiran](http://www.ravikiranmusic.com/) for an amazing East-West synthesis. Doordarshan (Indian National Television) broadcast this collaboration's stunning performance at the _Prayojana International Music Festival_ in Chennai, India. Natraj showcases Ravikiran on adaptations of Indian classical and original pieces, including works by Ravikiran who will also present an Indian classical segment.

Called "_an arresting virtuoso_" by the _Los Angeles Times_, and one of India's finest musicians, Ravikiran plays the Indian stringed instrument, the chitravina. He has performed and recorded with the BBC Philharmonic, blues legend Taj Mahal, and Grammy Award winner Glenn Velez. Radio National Australia hails Ravikiran as "_perhaps the greatest slide instrumentalist in the world today_."

_"Natraj…seamlessly fuses classical Indian music, the traditional music of West Africa and contemporary jazz to create its own style,"_ extols _Asian Age_ (Bengaluru, India). Along with Ravikiran, this concert features Natraj regulars Phil Scarff, soprano and sopranino saxophones; Mike Rivard, string bass; Jerry Leake, tabla and multi-percussion; and Bertram Lehman, drums and percussion.

### Improvisation and Electronics, with Neil Leonard and Robin Eubanks

[Neil Leonard](http://www.neilleonard.com/) is a sound artist / composer / saxophonist. His work includes jazz performance, composition for orchestra with computer generated video / sound, sound / music for dance, theater, installation, and film, including over 25 years performing with live-electronics and saxophone. Leonard's collaborations with visual arts have been featured at MoMA (NYC), the Whitney Biennial, the Havana Biennial, and will be featured in the Cuban Pavilion of the Venice Biennial (2013).

[Robin Eubanks](http://www.robineubanks.com/) is a premier jazz trombonist of his generation and a prolific composer / arranger, whose work has been featured by his own ensembles and been central to long-term associations with Dave Holland, McCoy Tyner, Elvin Jones, Art Blakey, the San Francisco Jazz Collective, and the M-Base Collective.

Leonard and Eubanks will perform solo works from their repertoire for saxophone / trombone and electronics and new duo compositions written for this concert. Their work creates a discourse that explores the implications of emerging technologies and their impact on jazz improvisation.

### Tre Corda

Whether reinventing jazz standards, breathing fresh life into classical repertoire, or premiering their own original works, [Tre Corda](https://www.freemusicdictionary.com/definition/tre-corde/#:~:text=Tre%20corda%20is%20the%20Italian,string%20in%20the%20bass%20register.) generates a compelling sound all its own. Their works blend composition and improvisation in new and unexpected ways, using the musical vocabulary of classical composers like Bartok and Stravinsky, as well as songs and ideas from the worlds of jazz and popular musics. Cellist Eugene Friesen's dynamic rhythms and incredible array of bowing and plucking techniques, trumpeter Greg Hopkins's virtuosic leaps and outrageous genre-bending phrases, and pianist Tim Ray's lyric melodicism and two-fisted pyrotechnics—these are just a few of the ways Tre Corda concerts have satisfied and delighted audiences with both jazz and classical expectations.
